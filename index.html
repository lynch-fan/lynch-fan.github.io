            <h1>Biography</h1> 
            <p>David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, musician, singer, sound designer,
            photographer, and actor. He is best known for writing and directing films such as Eraserhead (1977), The Elephant Man
            (1980), Blue Velvet (1986), and Mulholland Drive (2001), which are often regarded by critics as among the best films of
            their respective decades, and for his television series Twin Peaks (1990–1991). These works led to him being
            labeled "the first popular Surrealist" by film critic Pauline Kael. A recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 2019,
            he has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, and has won the César Award for Best Foreign Film
            twice, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the
            Venice Film Festival. He has been described by The Guardian as "the most important director of this era", while
            AllMovie called him "the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking".
            
            Lynch's first film, the surrealist horror Eraserhead (1977) became a success on the midnight movie circuit, and he
            followed that by directing The Elephant Man (1980), Dune (1984), and Blue Velvet (1986). Lynch next created his own
            television series with Mark Frost, the popular murder mystery Twin Peaks (1990–1991), which ran for two seasons. He also
            created the film prequel Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992), the road film Wild at Heart (1990), and the family film
            The Straight Story (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent
            films operated on dream logic non-linear narrative structures: Lost Highway (1997), Mulholland Drive (2001), and Inland
            Empire (2006). Lynch and Frost reunited in 2017 for a third season of Twin Peaks, which aired on Showtime. Lynch
            co-wrote and directed every episode, as well as reprising his onscreen role as Gordon Cole.

             <h1>Influences</h1>
             <p>Lynch says that his work is more similar in many respects to that of European filmmakers than American ones, believing
            that most films that "get down and thrill your soul" are from European directors.Lynch has commented on his
            admiration for such film makers as Federico Fellini, Werner Herzog, Alfred Hitchcock, Roman Polanski, and
            Jacques Tati, along with film directors Stanley Kubrick and Billy Wilder. He has stated that Wilder's Sunset
            Boulevard (1950) is one of his favorite motion pictures, as is Kubrick's Lolita (1962), Tati's Monsieur Hulot's
            Holiday (1953), Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954), and Herzog's Stroszek (1977). He has also cited Herk Harvey's
            Carnival of Souls (1962) and Jerzy Skolimowski's Deep End (1970) as an influence on his work.
